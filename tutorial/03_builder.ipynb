    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the **Builder** module in the `pysubmit` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The builder pattern provides a clean, modular way to inject logic into the simulation setup process.  \n",
    "It gives users \"hooks\" to modify or interact with the AEDT design in a structured and reusable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we cover three different builder classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `DesignVariableBuilder`: Modify design parameters\n",
    "2. `FunctionBuilder`: Run custom Python functions on the design\n",
    "3. `ScriptBuilder`: Load and run user-defined Python functions stored in external `.py` files\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:**  \n",
    "> These builders are especially useful when writing parameter sweeps or automating simulation workflows — topics we'll explore in later tutorials.\n"
