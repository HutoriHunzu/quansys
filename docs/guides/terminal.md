# 🖥️ Command-Line Usage Guide

The `pyhfss` command-line interface (CLI) allows you to manage simulation workflows using configuration files — no Python scripting needed.

There are two primary commands:

- `pyhfss run`: Run a simulation locally
- `pyhfss submit`: Submit a simulation job to a compute cluster

Both commands rely on a `config.yaml` file to define the workflow logic and parameters.

!!! tip "Getting command options"

    To explore available options for either command, use:
    
    ```bash
    pyhfss run --help
    pyhfss submit --help
    ```

---

## Local Execution with `run`

The `run` command is a configuration-based tool for executing workflows locally:

```bash
pyhfss run config.yaml
```

It is typically used to:

* Test the automation workflow before submitting to a cluster
* Run quick simulations for development or debugging

!!! tip
    Keep different `config.yaml` files for different simulation setups.
    This avoids duplicating Python code and makes testing easier.

    ```bash
    pyhfss run configs/design_3mm.yaml
    pyhfss run configs/design_4mm.yaml
    ```

## Cluster Submission with `submit`

The `submit` command packages and submits a simulation job to a compute cluster (e.g., LSF with `bsub`):

```bash
pyhfss submit config.yaml my_env --name job_name
```

This creates a new folder and places all required files inside it to run the job remotely.

### Expected Folder Layout

```text
job_name/
├── config.yaml
├── [copied input files]
├── simulate.sh
└── job_submission.sh
```

| File                   | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `config.yaml`          | The configuration file defining the simulation workflow            |
| `[copied input files]` | Any additional files provided via the `--files` option             |
| `simulate.sh`          | Activates `my_env` (Conda) and runs `pyhfss run config.yaml`       |
| `job_submission.sh`    | A submission script to run `simulate.sh` via `bsub` on the cluster |

!!! example "Usage example"
    ```bash
    pyhfss submit config.yaml my_env --name batch_run --files my_design.aedt --mem 160000 --timeout 06:00
    ```

!!! note
    `my_env` must be the name of a Conda environment available on the cluster.
    The environment is activated inside `simulate.sh`.

!!! note
    The number of CPUs requested from the cluster depends on the `cores` setting
    in your `EigenmodeAnalysis` simulation configuration.
