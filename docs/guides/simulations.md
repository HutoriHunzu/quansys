# üß™ Simulations Guide

This guide explains how to use the simulation classes provided in this package. It includes a quickstart example, how to handle results, and design principles.

## ‚úÖ Supported Simulation Types

The package currently supports the following simulations:

- [`EigenmodeAnalysis`](../api/eigenmode_analysis.md)  
- [`QuantumEPR`](../api/quantum_epr.md)

All simulation classes follow a consistent interface to make automation, result handling, and integration simple and predictable.

## üöÄ Quickstart Example

Let‚Äôs walk through how to run a basic simulation using the `EigenmodeAnalysis` class.

1. Make sure the `quansys` package is installed and your virtual environment is activated.
 
2. Create a simple AEDT design for the simulation. From your terminal:

    ```bash
    quansys example
    ```
    This command generates:

    - `simple_design.aedt`: a basic HFSS design with a single resonator.
   
    - `config.yml`: an automation config (see the [automation guide](automation.md)).

3. Create a Python script with the following content:

!!! example "Running a Simulation"
    ```python
    from quansys.simulation import EigenmodeAnalysis
    from quansys.workflow import PyaedtFileParameters

    # Load the AEDT design file
    run_params = PyaedtFileParameters(
        file_path="./simple_design.aedt",
        design_name="my_design",
        non_graphical=False  # We set to False to open the GUI, default is True
    )

    # Create an EigenmodeAnalysis instance
    analysis = EigenmodeAnalysis(
        design_name="my_design",
        setup_name="Setup1"
    )

    # opening the AEDT file and running the analysis
    with run_params.open_pyaedt_file() as hfss:
        result = analysis.analyze(hfss)

    # Access specific results
    result.results[1].quality_factor    # Quality factor for mode 1
    result.results[1].frequency         # Frequency for mode 1

    # For saving or aggregation, see .model_dump(), .flatten(), etc.
    ```

!!! note "Opening AEDT"
    You can refer to [`PyaedtFileParameters`](../api/pyaedt_file_parameters.md) for more information about the class. 
    In the above context we are using `run_params.open_pyaedt_file()` to open the specified AEDT file and ensures it is properly closed after the analysis. 
    However, you can also use raw `pyaedt` methods if you prefer more control over the AEDT session.

## üì§ Accessing & Saving Results

Simulation results are returned as structured objects, with methods for exporting and inspection:

- `result.model_dump()` ‚Üí Full result as a nested Python dictionary.
- `result.model_dump_json()` ‚Üí Same, but in JSON string format.
- `result.flatten()` ‚Üí A flat dictionary (key-value pairs) for easy storage or tabular conversion.

Use `.flatten()` for quick aggregation (e.g., pandas DataFrame), and `.model_dump()` for full detail or archival.

---

## üîÑ Serialization & Flattening

!!! note "About Flattening"
    The `.flatten()` method simplifies a result into a flat dictionary.  
    This is ideal for storing in databases or converting to tables ‚Äî but it may drop nested structure.

    For complete data retention:
    ```python
    result.model_dump()        # Full nested dictionary
    result.model_dump_json()   # JSON-formatted string
    ```

---

## üß† Design Philosophy

!!! abstract "Unified Simulation Interface"
    All simulation classes follow these two core rules:

    1. They implement an `.analyze(hfss)` method to run the simulation.
    2. They return a **JSON-serializable** result that supports `.flatten()` for aggregation.

This design allows easy integration into automation pipelines and downstream processing (e.g., logging, analysis, and visualization).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Notes

??? note "CPU Configuration"
    The [`EigenmodeAnalysis`](../api/eigenmode_analysis.md) class includes a `cores` attribute.  
    This can be used to control how many CPU cores are requested ‚Äî especially useful in cluster environments.
